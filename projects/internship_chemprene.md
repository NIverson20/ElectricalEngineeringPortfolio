# Internship at Chemprene LLC

## Internship Overview

During my internship at Chemprene LLC, I engaged in various engineering tasks that significantly impacted the operational efficiency and safety of the manufacturing processes.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Standard Operating Procedures:** Developed and refined several SOPs for critical manufacturing processes, enhancing both efficiency and safety.
- **Project Management:** Led the design and implementation of organizational racks in the plant, which helped optimize space and improve the working environment.
- **Technical Troubleshooting:** Played a key role in diagnosing and fixing critical faults with industrial machinery, notably the Industrial Press and Calendar machines.
- **Operational Analysis:** Tasked with diagnosing why a department was not meeting production targets. This involved comparing the actual time required to manufacture each product against the time it actually took, taking into account periods of downtime. This analysis helped identify bottlenecks and areas for process improvement.

## Achievements

- **Efficiency Improvements:** My work on SOPs, system optimizations, and operational analysis resulted in a measurable decrease in machine downtime and increased operational efficiency.
- **Safety Enhancements:** The projects I led, including the installation of safety platforms, directly contributed to a safer workplace, reducing the risk of accidents.
