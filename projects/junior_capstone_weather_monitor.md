# Junior Capstone Project: Low-Cost Microclimate Monitoring System

## Project Overview

In collaboration with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, our team was tasked with developing a cost-effective, low-power microclimate monitoring system. The focus of my work was on the Data Acquisition Subsystem, which is critical for accurately gathering environmental data in field units.

## Importance of the Project

This project is essential for understanding how climate change affects local microclimates, which has direct implications for agriculture and biodiversity conservation in New York State. By providing a scalable and affordable solution, we aim to facilitate more widespread and detailed environmental monitoring.

## Problem Statement

The goal was to develop a weather monitoring system that could provide accurate data on microclimate conditions at a fraction of the cost of existing systems. This system needed to be robust enough to withstand various weather conditions and provide reliable data that could help in the study of climate change effects.

## Key System Requirements

- **Accuracy:** Temperature measurements within ±5°C, relative humidity within ±5%.
- **Scalability:** The system should allow easy integration of additional sensors.
- **Durability:** Designed to endure harsh environmental conditions.

## My Role

- **System Design:** Contributed to the logical and physical design of the Data Acquisition Subsystem, ensuring it met the accuracy and scalability requirements.
- **Data Analysis:** Performed detailed analysis of sensor data to ensure reliability. Involved in testing and calibrating sensors against controlled data sets.
- **Prototype Development:** Assisted in building and testing the prototype in field conditions to assess its performance and durability.

## Challenges and Solutions

A significant challenge was ensuring sensor accuracy in variable environmental conditions. We addressed this through rigorous calibration and by designing a robust housing that protected the sensors from environmental factors while ensuring accurate data transmission.

## Results and Impact

The prototype demonstrated the potential for cost-effective monitoring of microclimates, with the total cost of the system around $35. It provided valuable insights into local temperature and humidity variations, offering a scalable solution that could be deployed across various parts of the state.
