# NNL Capstone Project: Energy Harvesting Device

## Project Overview

As part of my Capstone project at the University at Albany, I worked on designing and developing a microcontroller-based sensor prototype that could operate autonomously without an external power supply for at least 30 days. This project focused on utilizing different types of energy transducers to achieve sustainable energy harvesting.

## My Role

My responsibilities included:
- **Design and Simulation:** Assisting in the selection and design of energy transducers, including solar, RF, heat, and vibration options.
- **Data Analysis:** Conducting extensive tests to measure the efficiency and output of each transducer under varying conditions.
- **Prototype Development:** Collaborating in the development of the embedded system, integrating the microcontroller with the energy transducers.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the significant challenges was optimizing the energy consumption of the microcontroller to extend its operational life. Through iterative testing and adjustments, we managed to reduce the power draw to micro-watt levels, aligning with the energy output from the transducers.

## Results and Impact

The project successfully demonstrated that the prototype could last indefinitely with the right configuration of power management and transducers, showcasing a viable solution for long-term energy-independent sensors.
